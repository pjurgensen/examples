# To Do List with SQL

* Create a test database to run your specs and a development database to run your program/UI.

* Copy your dev database schema for your test database:
	CREATE DATABASE to_do_test WITH TEMPLATE to_do_development;

* CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Destroy) - just about everything you would want to do on a database-backed object can be boiled down to these four actions.
