#Active Record

* Active Record is a class your class can inherit from that gives you database interaction 'out of the box'.

* Active Record is an Object Relational Mapping (ORM) library. The library provides a base class that, when subclassed, sets up a mapping between the new class and an existing table in the database.

* Instead of dealing directly with the database by writing SQL queries and inserts, we can use Active Record's prebuilt functionality.
